ZedMemes Design Document

Page 1 - CSS Framework & DB Design

Framework Chosen: Foundation CSS
- Reason: Mobile-first, flexible grid system, easy modals

Database Design:

Table       | Description
------------|------------------------------
users       | Stores user accounts
memes       | Stores uploaded image data
reactions   | Stores like/upvote per meme

Relationships:
- memes.user_id → users.id
- reactions.user_id & meme_id → many-to-one

Page 2 - Frontend/Backend Structure & Challenges

Frontend:
- HTML + Foundation CSS
- jQuery for AJAX, modals, and interaction
- AJAX used for login, signup, upload, and reactions

Backend:
- PHP handles sessions, DB ops, file uploads, and reactions
- MySQL for persistent data storage
- includes/auth.php for session and auth checks

Challenges Faced:
- AJAX file uploads via modal forms
- Preventing duplicate reactions
- Mobile responsiveness with dynamic content

Solutions:
- Used FormData with jQuery for uploads
- Enforced UNIQUE constraint in reactions table
- Used Foundation’s grid + media queries for responsiveness
